The code is a quick hack, still lots that can be done.

 * handle mp3s in reseed.py build_search_queries()
 * get migrate/cross-seed mode from command line 
 * get old torrent directory from command line
 * enable the 'close file size' code
 * better code comments
 * code is completely untestable right now
 * in migrate mode, maybe mv torrents with no match into an 'unmatched' folder so they're not retested in the next run
